# UPS - a Ruby gem to generate UPS shipping labels

This gem is an (unofficial) wrapper around the XML-based api provided by [Ups](http://www.ups.com/). It allows you to build and send a shipment request, schedule a shipment for pickup, and generate a shipping label. 

It is currently a work in progress. I hope to release the first version soon.


# TODO
Currently only the basics to get labels generated is implemented. There are a ton of optional fields and alternate shipping methods that I have not yet added in. These are indicated throughout the codebase, marked as 'TODO'.
